                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The Gambia, the smallest country on mainland Africa, is located in West Africa and follows the Gambia 
                    River inland from the Atlantic coast with Islam being the dominant religion. The Gambia’s economy relies 
                    heavily on agriculture, tourism, and fishing. Known for its rich cultural heritage and diverse wildlife, 
                    it attracts tourists to its national parks, beaches, and historical sites like Kunta Kinteh Island. The 
                    Gambia gained independence from Britain in 1965 and has experienced periods of political stability and change.

            <section id="History">
                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>The Gambia has a rich history, having been a major trading post during the transatlantic slave trade.
                   The Gambia, a small West African nation, has a rich history shaped by indigenous ethnic groups and 
                   European colonization. In the 15th century, the region became a significant hub for the transatlantic 
                   slave trade, later coming under British control. The Gambia gained independence from Britain in 1965, 
                   with Sir Dawda Kairaba Jawara as its first president. A military coup in 1994 brought Yahya Jammeh 
                   to power, who ruled for over two decades until he was ousted in 2017. Today, The Gambia is known 
                   for its resilience and strong national identity.

            <section id="Geography">
                <h2>Geography</h2>
                <p>The Gambia is the smallest country on mainland Africa, located in West Africa. It is a narrow strip 
                    of land that follows the Gambia River inland for about 320 kilometers (200 miles). Bordered by 
                    Senegal on three sides and the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the country is mostly flat with savannahs 
                    and low hills. The Gambia River, a central feature of the country, is vital for transportation,
                     agriculture, and fishing. The climate is tropical, with a distinct rainy season and dry season. 
                     Despite its small size, The Gambia has diverse ecosystems, including wetlands, forests, and mangroves.</p>

            <section id="Population">
                <h2>Population</h2>
                <p>The Gambia has a population of around 2.5 million people, made up of various ethnic groups. The majority 
                   of Gambians are Muslim, with a small Christian minority. The population is predominantly young, with a 
                   significant portion under the age of 25. While many live in rural areas, urbanization is increasing, 
                   especially in and around the capital, Banjul, and the largest city, Serekunda.

                <h2>Culture</h2>
                <p>Gambian culture is a blend of various ethnic groups, each with its own traditions and languages.
                   The Gambia's culture is rich and diverse, influenced by various ethnic groups such as the Mandinka, 
                   Fula, Wolof, Jola, and Serahule. These groups contribute unique traditions, languages, music, and
                    customs to the country’s cultural landscape. Islam is the predominant religion, shaping many aspects
                    of daily life, celebrations, and festivals. Music and dance play central roles in Gambian culture,
                    with kora music being a distinctive form of traditional storytelling through song. The Gambia also 
                    has a strong tradition of oral history, with griots (storytellers) preserving the history and heritage 
                    of families and communities. Despite modern influences, Gambians maintain strong ties to their cultural roots.

                    Tourism is a key sector in The Gambia's economy, often referred to as "The Smiling Coast of Africa" due to its welcoming
